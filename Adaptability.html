          <p>As for my Sons of the Revolution (SAR) Essay, that is a demonstration of my knowledge and ability to fill a rubric that was set for me to complete. The goal of the essay was to write a paper on a significant yet overlooked aspect of the American Civil War. Granted I don’t have a huge love for history so I had to do some research, but in writing this essay I was able to demonstrate to myself and also others by having it win the State level competition that I can adapt my writing to any situation whether it be educational or opinionated.

          <p>I’ve demonstrated adaptability through my show paper as example by me never having written something like this before, my show paper was the first time I’ve ever done and analysis of a musical and I was worried I might struggle. Granted I did struggle but in the end, I was able to learn and adapt to what my professor was asking me to do. He didn’t want some fancy education or sources cited paper; he wanted his students’ opinions of the plays they went to see. Once I understood that I knew what I was doing and adapted my writing to see fit.
