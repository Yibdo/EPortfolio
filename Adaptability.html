            <b>Selection:</b> For research genre production, I chose my Sons of the Revolution (SAR) Essay as one of my examples. The SAR Essay is a demonstration of my knowledge and ability to fill a rubric that was set for me to complete. The goal of the essay was to write a paper on a significant yet overlooked aspect of the American Revolution. To do so, I had to complete historical research on the specific era of history and then write a paper that was accurate, “exactly 500 words no more, no less.”, and relevant to the prompt. For my paper, I chose to write about the unsung heroes of the American Revolution, such as the civilians, women, and clergy. I feel that this is an exemplary example of outcome three because, unlike everything else I’ve written, this essay was entered into a competition for a scholarship, and had a lot of strict rules that were necessary to follow, or I would have been docked points.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> I learned a lot from my SAR essay, especially about how to do historical research. During high school, I didn’t enjoy history in the slightest, and this paper was my first experience writing a proper paper that required historical accuracy. I had to read different academic sources and find examples of my topic through the use of proper research methods.

            <b>Selection:</b> For my second example of outcome three, research genre production, I have chosen my show paper. My show paper was an assignment for my theatre survey class and required me to watch three different Broadway musicals, take notes on one of them, and then write a four-page paper on different parts of play production they used during the play. I believe I’ve satisfied outcome three through my show paper. This is because I have never written something like this before; the show paper was the first time I’ve ever done an analysis of a musical, and unlike my SAR paper, I was surprised by the lack of a strict rubric. The focus of the paper was to write an opinionated analysis of the selected play, taking notes of different play methods that were used, such as lighting, costume, props, and actors. I believe this is another significant example of outcome three because it is both recent and diverse from the other papers I’ve produced.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> I learned a lot from my show paper, for example, that not all college papers have to be serious research papers with pages of resources and citations. It exposed me to the importance of knowing not only about the general topic, but also about all the intricacies and small details you can take note of in order to expand and use them to talk more in depth about your topic.
