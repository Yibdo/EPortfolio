            <b>Selection:</b> For the Contributing knowledge outcome, I chose my research proposal because it is a great example of drawing conclusions from the interpretation of primary evidence. In my paper, I made conclusions from the three primary sources I used when developing my research question. These primary sources were three different studies done on the effects of social media/ technology on the emotional development of the youth. Along with the analysis of multiple comments from the subreddit r/SeriousConversations. I believe my research proposal is a strong choice for the Contributing Knowledge outcome because it shows my ability to take apart different primary sources and draw out a basis for the hypothesis of my second paper, English Project 2. 
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> What I learned from writing my Research proposal is how to introduce a topic and the articles I find relevant to the exigence of the paper, such as introducing my reason for writing the paper, talking about how there seems to be a decline in the younger generation's ability to empathize with each other after constant use of social media and technology.  I learned how to combine a topic I’m interested in with a project relevant to my class and discuss a larger issue throughout my paper.

            <b>Selection:</b> For my second example of outcome four, contributing knowledge, I chose my second English project. This project was essentially the final paper for my English class and was meant to reflect my ability to develop, research, analyze, and draw a conclusion based on my findings. I did this by comparing my analysis of primary source comments with my research studies to see if the opinion of the general public aligned with scientific findings. English Project Two is a great example of contributing knowledge, and I found it to be fairly significant to me because I enjoyed writing the paper and analyzing the opinions of different comments in order to develop the conclusion to my hypothesis. 
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> I learned about combining research and primary sources from English Project Two. It allowed me to explore and learn about the popular opinions the public had about social media's effect on the mental development of the youth. It also taught me that primary sources can be found in unlikely places, such as an online forum like Reddit. It was quite a personal paper, seeing as how I learned about the possible side effects my sister could be experiencing from young social media usage.
