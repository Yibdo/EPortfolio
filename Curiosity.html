            <b>Selection:</b><br> QQC One fits this outcome of generating inquiry because I made and examined questions asked through writing and language. In my opinion, this is the best example of this outcome. The prompt of the QQC asks you to select a quotation from the reading. Then explain why you chose it, what it makes you think as a reader/writer, and what its significance is. Once an answer is given on why this quotation was selected, you then ask your peers a question. From this, I feel like QQC One was a perfect example of generating inquiry because you must read and select a part of the reading to ask questions, while also relating the significance of why you chose that quotation. I think other examples for generating inquiry could also correlate, such as Project One and Project Two on a broader scale. However, I felt that the QQC was an overall more in-depth example of generating inquiry. I feel like QQC One could be connected with some of our early classwork when we found primary sources through the UCF library for our topics in search of Project One. I felt that doing QQC One allowed me to look for information in a certain way and ask important questions about it. 

            <br><b>Reflection:</b><br> From QQC One, I learned how to ask more in-depth questions for my reading. While also looking for the main idea of it. It also allowed me to see what my peers thought of the readings and see different sides of things in terms of asking questions that I could use for the next assignment. I felt this was significant to me because it allowed me to extensively look at the material given to me and become more attentive to certain types of writing and what to look for while I am writing.

            <b>Selection:</b> QQC Two fits the outcome of generating inquiry because, like the prior QQC two, its final task is to propose a question based on the reading, which satisfies the basic definition of the generating inquiry outcome, but in QQC two, I expand on the holes Bitzer left in his definition of the rhetorical situation. Comparing and agreeing with the points that Grant-Davie proposes in his article allowed me not only to generate a question but also to explore the questions I had previously. That is why I think QQC two is another great example of outcome one. QQC one focuses on generating a question, but in QQC two, I expand on my previous questions in addition to generating a new question for my class to respond to.

            <br><b>Reflection:</b> In QQC two, I was able to reflect on my prior QQC and reading in order to produce a higher-quality analysis. Comparing and contrasting the works of Bitzer and Grant-Davie helped me better understand that not all resources are foolproof, which is related to my final paper which I had to use multiple sources to reinforce different claims the comments made. QQC two felt significant to me because it was one of my first works in this class. I enjoyed the discussion it generated during our class discussions.
