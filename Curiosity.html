          <p>Being able to “Generate Inquiry” simply means to be curious you’re able to find something you’re
             interested in and can then write or speak about it. I believe I’ve made progress towards this 
             outcome because I’m able to hold conversations with other people. I can talk or discuss things that 
             they and/or I may find interesting to combat the impending boredom that may follow a lack of 
             conversation. I believe I have proficient ability to “Generate Inquiry” because during classes such 
             as honors symposium, the second half is considered a breakout room where we discuss how we 
             interpreted the speaker’s message and it’s a great time to practice my ability to generate inquiry 
             because we have to pick apart and question the speakers presentation and how he went about 
             doing it. Through writing project 1 I’ve achieved this outcome because I found something I’m 
             interested in i.e. the effects technology can have on the socio-emotional development of the youth 
             and have been able to explore different points of view such as the downsides or upsides.
