          <p>Quote

"In contrast, imagine a person spending his time writing eulogies of men and women who never existed: his speeches meet no rhetorical situations; they are summoned into existence not by real events, but by his own imagination. They may exhibit formal features which we consider rhetorical - such as ethical and emotional appeals, and stylistic patterns; conceivably one of these fictive eulogies is even persuasive to someone; yet all remain unrhetorical unless, through the oddest of circumstances, one of them by chance should fit a situation. " (Pg 9 Bitzer)

Response

I choose this quote because I believe it ironically aligned with this assignment. Without the prompt from the QQC this response would not be fit to be considered rhetorical, the exigence of this Rhetorical Situation is the prompt, the audience our professor and classmates with me trying to persuade you all that this is a fitting response which in turn satisfies the requirements this is a Rhetorical situation, and the constraints being the word count, time limit, and response outline. Thinking about it this way makes me realize that the assignment itself embodies Bitzer’s definition of a rhetorical situation.

Question

My question to you is, "By Blitzer's own definition does this mean that this response is only rhetorical because it's been assigned, or could I have written all this without prompt, and it still be rhetorical?"

          <p>Being able to “Generate Inquiry” simply means to be curious you’re able to find something you’re
             interested in and can then write or speak about it. I believe I’ve made progress towards this 
             outcome because I’m able to hold conversations with other people. I can talk or discuss things that 
             they and/or I may find interesting to combat the impending boredom that may follow a lack of 
             conversation. I believe I have proficient ability to “Generate Inquiry” because during classes such 
             as honors symposium, the second half is considered a breakout room where we discuss how we 
             interpreted the speaker’s message and it’s a great time to practice my ability to generate inquiry 
             because we have to pick apart and question the speakers presentation and how he went about 
             doing it. Through writing project 1 I’ve achieved this outcome because I found something I’m 
             interested in i.e. the effects technology can have on the socio-emotional development of the youth 
             and have been able to explore different points of view such as the downsides or upsides.
