            <b>Selection:</b><br> QQC One fits this outcome of generating inquiry because I made and examined
             questions asked through writing and language. In my opinion, this is the best example of this outcome.
              The prompt of the QQC asks you to select a quotation from the reading. Then explain why you chose it,
               what it makes you think as a reader/writer, and what is the significance of it. Once an answer is 
               given on why this quotation was selected, you then ask your peers a question. From this, I feel like 
               QQC One was a perfect example of generating inquiry because you must read and select a part of the 
               reading to ask questions while also relating the significance of why you chose that quotation. I 
               think other examples for generating inquiry could also correlate such as Project One and Project 
               Two on a broader scale. However, I felt that the QQC was an overall more in-depth example of 
               generating inquiry. I feel like QQC One could be connected with some of our early classwork when
                we found primary sources through the UCF library for our topics in search of Project One. I felt
                 that doing QQC One allowed me to look for information a certain way and ask important questions about it. 

            <br><b>Reflection:</b><br> From QQC One, I learned how to ask more in-depth questions for my reading. While also 
            looking for the main idea of it. It also allowed me to see what my peers thought of the readings and see different 
            sides of things in terms of asking questions that I could use for the next assignment. I felt this was significant 
            to me because it allowed me to extensively look at the material given to me and become more attentive to certain 
            types of writing and what to look for while I am writing.
