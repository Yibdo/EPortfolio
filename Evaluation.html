          <p> Information Literacy means to be able to take a reading assignment and relevant literature of some sort and be
              able to locate/discern what useful/relevant information there is to the assignment you’ve been given. I’ve come
              far in terms of this outcome, I used to have a hard time reading and stay focused on the task at hand. Now I’m
              able to do such analyzing articles easily and can retain the information without having to note down too much. I
              think what has caused me to grow the most in this area is my education all the English classes I took throughout
              high school and studying for the SAT allow for me to target and improve different aspects of my information
              literacy prowess. Not only that but writing project 1 has definitely show me that I’ve come very far in terms of
              skill, I was able to read and decipher different dense research studies and nitpick the information that would be
              relevant to my project (countering or supporting).
