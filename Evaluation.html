            <b>Selection:</b> The baby bibliography is a perfect example of information literacy because it shows my ability to find academic sources relevant to my research proposal and analyze them to provide a descriptive summary. The assignment was to find two different articles relevant to my research topic, read them, and write a short summary of the relevant research mentioned in each paper. The point is to refresh my memory of different articles when recalling them for my final paper. The baby bibliography is significant enough to be one of my examples of information literacy because it shows my ability to analyze dense academic articles and provide a summary for later on, based on information relevant to my research paper, and cite them appropriately.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> During the writing of my baby bibliography, I learned how to find credible sources using UCF’s online library and sift through different results to find the most relevant studies/ information. I also learned how to use keywords, read dense articles efficiently, and maintain an unbiased standing when summarizing the findings of articles, even if they don’t agree with my hypothesis.

            <b>Selection:</b> Comment analysis is a fantastic example of the information literacy outcome. The goal of information literacy is for a student to demonstrate their ability to read through material and evaluate it based on a set of criteria, whether that be relevance, credibility, or quality. For my comment analysis, I analyzed 9 comments from 2 different posts on the r/SeriousConversations subreddit. The rubric for these comments was based on three things: relevance, interaction rating, and uniqueness. For relevance, I had to confirm whether or not comments were actually responding to the post or just going on a tangent about an irrelevant subject. Interaction rating was a part of the rubric because the more upvotes/response comments on a post had the more likely it was to be a popular opinion. Uniqueness was included because there were far too many comments on each post that were essentially the exact same, along with many essay-like responses explaining growing up without social media.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> During my analysis of comments, I learned about the necessity for a rubric when collecting data from online forums such as Reddit; without one, I would have had over 20 of the same comment, all proposing the same point. It also encouraged me to include comments that countered my research in order to make an unbiased and informative research paper that acknowledged both sides of the hypothesis.
