            <b>Selection:</b> The Formal Reflective paper demonstrates the sixth outcome of multiple ways of writing by demonstrating my ability to write a formal business letter to my future self. In contrast to all the other papers I have written for my classes in college, none were like writing a business letter. It is a completely different format when compared to that of a research paper. There are no citations, claims, evidence, or reasoning to support it. I believe this is a significant artifact for outcome six because it demonstrates my ability to write with a formal tone from one person to another, which is different from the rest of my writing assignments in this class; they have all been regarded with research and analysis of informal comments.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> I’ve learned how to write a formal letter from this assignment. In particular, I learned about the formatting of a business letter, where to indent, and how to refer to myself in the future. I believe it’s been an important process for me to know when I need to write a formal letter for something more significant, such as my job.

         <p class="dropdown-text">
            <b>Selection:</b> Success fits outcome six because it is a different form of writing, as it fits into the category of responding to a discussion post. For the assignment, my Success paper was written because I had to first redefine success in my own words, and then expand on the topic in any direction I’d like. In order to do this, I redefined the word success as achieving the desired result, and then explained how that means success means being happy. This is one of my most significant forms of different writing because it was a discussion post response and did not require a search. It was entirely opinion-based and was very different compared to the other styles of writing I have experienced in this English class.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> I learned a lot about myself in writing my success paper. I had to redefine what that word meant to me, and I think that was something everyone should do once in their life. It allowed me to experience what it was like to write an opinionated response to an assignment rather than having to back up my claims with formal research, like other assignments I have done.
