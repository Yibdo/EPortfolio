            <b>Selection:</b> English Project 1 demonstrates the revision outcome because it has gone through multiple drafting phases. I started out with my introduction and went through three different styles until I found one I liked for my research proposal. Initially, I went with an informal draft to just get my thoughts on the paper, reviewed that, and formed a formal introduction. After I had to style out the introduction of each different set of sources, such as my primary research, secondary research, and Reddit discussion posts. This had another two phases that I had reviewed and received feedback on. In the beginning, I had a very rough draft introducing the Reddit communities I was going to use and the different sources I mentioned in my annotated bibliography. In the end, I finalized it with more formal writing and in-depth explanations of the background of each source I planned to use. This is a significant artifact for the outcome of revision because it shows how many stages I went through in order to make a finished project that I was proud of, and there were a lot of stages.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> For my English Project 1, I learned the usefulness of spacing out a workload into different sections and the power that proper feedback can give to a person’s writing. Whenever I received feedback, I was able to understand the next direction I should go with my writing, which improved it even more. This is important because I have, in the past, always had a hard time finding direction to go with in my writing. And I learned how to space out my workload to make it more time manageable, instead of just doing it all in one night, I was able to structure it out and receive feedback accordingly.

            <b>Selection:</b> I’ve demonstrated the outcome of revision throughout my annotated bibliography by taking the comments and concerns I had received regarding my baby bibliography into account when creating my new annotated bibliography for my English project 1. I went from making a messy summary of each article I read to creating a complete review of the five different peer-reviewed papers/studies. I will dissect each article and condense the significant details into paragraphs that I will be able to call upon during the later writing stages of my research proposal. This is a fantastic example of revision because I had taken into account the comments I received on my original, sloppy first baby bibliography and turned it into a much cleaner, organized bibliography that I was able to call upon when writing my research proposal and English project 2 paper.
            <br><b>Reflection:</b> From the revisions I made during the writing of my annotated bibliography, I learned how to make proper citations and summaries of different articles I had read. Because of this,  I was able to find documents that would later be helpful to cite during the analysis of comments, and was able to use them to back up or counter any ambiguous claims with the comments in each discussion post made.
